LOFTLY - FRACTIONAL WELLNESS PROPERTIES ON THE COSTA BLANCA

WHAT WE DO:
Loftly offers Token-Key fractional ownership in wellness-designed villas on Spain's Costa Blanca. Each Token-Key represents real equity in a property-specific Spanish SL (Sociedad Limitada). Owners appear on the title deed with full property rights and appreciation.

PRICING:
- 1/12 Share (Token-Key): EUR 125,000-150,000 | 4+ weeks/year guaranteed usage
- 1/8 Share (Token-Key): EUR 185,000-225,000 | 6+ weeks/year guaranteed usage
- Service charge: ~EUR 50/day during stays (utilities, supplies, welcome basket)
- Operating costs: EUR 2,500-3,500/year (your share of management)

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Purchase a Token-Key share in a specific villa
2. Own real equity in the property SL (on the title deed)
3. Book your weeks through our scheduling system (fair peak-season rotation)
4. Professional management handles everything (maintenance, cleaning, concierge)
5. Unused weeks can be banked or rented for income
6. Exit by selling your Token-Key share (property appreciation included)

TAX ADVANTAGES:
- No Modelo 720 annual reporting for non-residents (shares under EUR 50k)

- Inheritance benefits through Spanish legal framework

90-DAY SCHENGEN RULE:
UK and US nationals are limited to 90 days per 180-day period. Fractional ownership at 4-8 weeks/year is perfectly optimized for this constraint.

COMPETITIVE POSITIONING:
- vs Pacaso: We focus on wellness design and the product ecosystem, not just co-ownership logistics
- vs Vivla: We build community and multigenerational design, not just luxury vacation homes
- vs August: We are real estate first with a product line, not a travel membership
- Our moat: In-house construction, wellness brand, product ecosystem (linens, bath, local goods)

- Organic linens (GOTS-certified), Mediterranean bath & body (refillable glass)
- Quarterly local goods subscriptions (olive oil, wine, artisanal goods)
- Token-Key owners get 25% discount on all subscriptions
